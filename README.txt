All of the enclosed documents, and the website, are almost entirely my own work.
The only exception is that, while grading, some help was given by Dr. Julie Adams in the form of comments,
as can be seen in the usabilityTestPlan_v2.pdf document.

The website which I created for this study is still online (as of 01/16/2019).
It can be found at http://www.briangauch.com/hci_project/ although its functionality may have diminished.
